1)Note,I have added the dependency for icons: implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:$compose_ui_version"
under the Gradle scripts.

Path:
 click on Gradle scripts on your left side (symbol of elephant)->open by clicking on build.gradle(note there are two build.gradle,you are advised to click on 
 Module:Name_of_your_application.app).After adding there will be a sync option bar poping up.Just click on it and your dependency is added.

2)I have also used
  LocalSoftwareKeyboardController.current as one of my states.

  val keyboardController=LocalSoftwareKeyboardController.current

 if you use then a red line will show under LocalSoftwareKeyboardController .Don't panic just hover over the red line and it will ask you to import,click on import and its pretty much done.

 it will show @OptIn(ExperimentalComposeUiApi::class) after import over your composable.This is because this class is still experimental in android development community.
